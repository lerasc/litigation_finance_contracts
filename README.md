Here, we implement the litigation finance contracts as described in our paper [1]. 
The file plaintiff_lawfirm_contract.py implements the contract between plaintiff and law firm in absence of third-party funding (section 4 in the paper). 
The file plaintiff_lawfirm_funder_contract.py implements the contract between third-party funder, law firm and plaintiff (section 5 in the paper). 
This is work in progress and feedback is welcome. Please send to slera@mit.edu.
